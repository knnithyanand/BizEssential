# BizEssentials
## Objective
To create a common framework or library containing a set of classes and functions that can be used to build modern business applications.

Often we come accross projects that repeat a lot of objects, we either copy the classes or even create shared library. But these libraries their classes differ from developer to developer. This introduces a challenge while developing open standards based applications that can complement each other instead of rebuild from scratch or have overlaping functions.

For Example:

Consider objects like:
- Postal Address
- Phone Number
- Customer / User / Individual / Contact
- Order
- Company / Business / Organization
- Branch / Office / Warehouse
- User Group

While each of these items have common meaning and set off fields accross all the Apps yet they have different shape and hence cannot be shared between Apps.
